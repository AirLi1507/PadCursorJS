# PadCursorJS

## iPad-Like Cursor for HTML using JavaScript and CSS

---

I've made this a few months ago because I seen some similar custom cursor that is also achieved by JavaScript and CSS on other websites.

This is a little different from the original one from iPadOS since its state of hovering text also works for the HTML elements listed below, you can also remove them if you don't want them to be hovered.

- h1
- h2
- h3
- h4
- h5
- h6
- a
- p
- span

# Licensing for this project

Since I made this just because I was interested in it, and even published on Github as you see now, you can use this project freely, the only thing you have to remember is NOT to remove the credits part from the code, thank you.
